This book is not really the place to fully explain Test-Driven Development (TDD)
but it is one of the more useful ways to manage cadence and limit the scope of
changes so that pair programmers may switch keyboards more often.

PingPong and Baseball are TDD "games" describe in most useful TDD texts.
